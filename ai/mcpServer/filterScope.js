// table -- "projects"/"users"/"customers" (live, per-user REST access),
// the static reference tables like "projectStages" (hand-curated config),
// and every OTHER table that transitively references one of those via a
// foreign key (a time entry whose project's stage is hidden, a booking on
// a project the caller can't see, ...) -- with views scoped to the current
// caller, so the agent's arbitrary SQL (execute_spp_query) is automatically
// scoped no matter how it's written -- the agent never sees a row it
// shouldn't, directly OR by way of something it references. Downstream
// only: hiding a project hides things that reference the project, never
// the (upstream) customer it belongs to. See reportEngine.js's
// getScopingPlan for how the downstream table set and build order are
// computed from RELATIONSHIPS.
//
// Why the raw materialized tables get renamed to "*_raw" rather than
// building the view directly as "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW projects AS SELECT
// * FROM projects WHERE ...": this Lambda's DuckDB connection is cached and
// reused across warm-container invocations, potentially for different
// people. A self-referential CREATE OR REPLACE (view named "projects"
// selecting FROM "projects") would bind to whatever currently answers to
// that name -- on the second caller in the same container, that's the
// FIRST caller's already-filtered view, not the raw table, silently
// intersecting two different people's access instead of scoping each
// person's request independently. Renaming the raw table once (idempotent,
// self-healing after reportEngine.js re-materializes it) gives the view a stable,
// unshadowed source to always select from.
