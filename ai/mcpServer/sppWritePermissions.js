// Orchestrates the three independent permission layers a write must pass,
// all required, none sufficient alone -- see the write-feature design
// discussion for why each exists separately:
//   (a) row-visibility -- can this person even reference/see the record at
//       all, reusing the SAME scoped DuckDB views filterScope.js already
//       built this request (never the "_raw" tables)
//   (b) role-based CRUD -- does their SPP role (users.role_id) permit this
//       action on this table, per the hand-curated rolePermissions data
//   (c) global platform capability -- is this action even possible on this
//       table via SPP's API at all, regardless of role (sppWriteClient.js)
//
// This runs FIRST and is a real decision-maker, not a formality ahead of
// SPP's own server-side enforcement -- SPP's enforcement is the second,
// independent "guardian." If this layer approves something SPP then
// rejects, that's a distinct, actionable case (see writeTools.js's
// markRejectedBySpp/driftSuspected handling), not just an ordinary failure.
